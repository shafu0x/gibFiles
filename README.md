I built this for myself. So use accordingly bro.

### Why?

I wanna get the text of some files to copy/paste into chat-gpt directly. This works best for me. Not sure why. This extension gives you a list of all files that you can select from. You can also select entire directories.

Then run `> Gib Files` to copy the text inside all selected files into your clipboard.
